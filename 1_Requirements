COMPONENTS
STM32F407VG Microcontroller Board

DESCRIPTION
STM32F407VG
The STM32F407 Kit takes advantage of the high-performance STM32F407 microcontrollers capabilities to mak eit simple for users to create audio-based application. It comes with an ST-LINK embedded debug tool, an ST-MEMS digital accelerometer, a digital microphone, an audio DAC with integrated class D speaker driver, LEDs, pushbuttons and USB OTG micro-AB connector. Ethernet connectivity, an LCD Display and other features have been added ti the STM32F4 DISCOVERY kit. the STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx families are built around the high performance Arm cortex -M4 bit RISC core, which runs at up to 168 MHz.

FEATURES OF STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER

Up to 1 Mbyte of flash memory
Up to 192+4 Kbytes of SRAM including 64-Kbytes of CCM (Core Coupled Memory) data RAM.
512 bytes of OTP memory.
Flexible static memory controller supporting Compact flash SRAM, PSRAM, NOR and NAND memories

WORKING PRINCIPLE

Assume that the automobiles is the microcontroller. If the button is hit, the first led (red) will turn on, clicking again the wiper will start and the second led (blue) will turn in for a desired rate. If the button os pressed again, the third led (green) will turn on, and the wiper's speed will be increased in comparison to the previous one. The fourth press will turn on the fourth led (orange), and the wiper speed will be increased in accordance with the previous one. the microcontroller (vehicle) is turned off after the fifth click.

USES
This microcontroller is utilised in printing and scanning machines, heat ventilation, air conditioning and security system.
This module can be found in a variety of household product.

4W'S AND 1H
WHERE
Most of the vehicles have two wipers on the windshield one on the rear windshield and the other on the front windshield. some have a single wiper system.
WHY
The main purpose of the wiper system is to clean the wind screen sufficiently to provide clear visibility at all the time.
WHEN
The main purpose is to be clear the winshield from rain, oil, dust and snow. so that we use wiper whenever these things get struck to the windshield.
WHAT
Wiper system comprises a wiper drive and two wiper arms at a certain angle across the windshield. it is used to remove the dust, water, oil and snow.
HOW
Wiper systems are operated by an electric motor which is attached to a worn gear. It transmits the necessary force to a long rod that sets the wiper arms in motion. The worm gear is able to generate the force required to move the wipers as fast as they need to move.

SWOT ANALYSIS

STRENGTH
Decrease the accidental situation
Decreases the environmental pollution.
Decreases the fuel consumption.
Increase safety
Capacity increases under shot gaps.
WEEKNESS

Limited speed
Capacity decreases under conservation gaps.
cost is high.
High maintenance.
Can be frustrating at low penetration rates.

OPPORTUNITIES

Technology maturity may reduce system cost.
Enables novel MTM application.

THREATS
User acceptance in terms of both purchase intention and frequent activation after purchase.
Cost
MTM delayed adapation.
